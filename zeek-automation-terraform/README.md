#  Google Zeek Automation Module

![Terraform Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/tf-%3E%3D0.13.5-blue.svg)

This module simplifies the deployment of Zeek so GCP customers can feed raw packets from VPC Packet Mirroring and produce rich security telemetry for threat detection and investigation in our Chronicle Security Platform.


## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform `v0.13.5` or above.


## Examples

Examples of how to use these modules can be found in the [examples](examples) folder.
- [Basic Configurations](examples/basic_configurations): Demonstrates how to use google zeek automation module with basic configurations.
- [Mirror Resource Filtering](examples/mirror_resource_filtering): Demonstrates how to specify mirror vpc network sources, for packet mirroring policy.
- [Packet Mirroring Traffic Filtering](examples/packet_mirroring_traffic_filtering): Demonstrates how to use traffic filtering parameters for packet-mirroring policy.


## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture-diagram/architecture.png "Architecture")


## Features

- Creates regional managed instance groups using same network peering between mirror-collector vpc for collecting logs from mirror vpc sources.
- Enables regional packet mirroring policies for mirroring mirror vpc sources like:
    - mirror-vpc subnets
    - mirror-vpc tags
    - mirror-vpc instances
  
  with optional parametes like: ip_protocols, direction, & cidr_ranges.
- Enables packaging of logs in order to send it to Chronicle Platform.  


## Pre-requisites

1. [Packer Image](#packer-image) should exists before running terraform script.
2. Terraform is [installed](#software-dependencies) on the machine where Terraform is executed.
3. The Service Account you execute the module with has the right [permissions](#configure-a-service-account).
4. The Compute Engine APIs are [active](#enable-apis) on the project you will launch the infrastructure on.
5. User must create a GCS Bucket.


### Packer Image

   There are two ways for using packer image:
   - [Use pre-configured image](#use-pre-configured-image)
   - [Create your own custom image](#create-your-own-custom-image)

#### Use Pre-Configured Image
- One can use our pre-configured packer image which is published on GCP and publicly available to all.
- We have already configured our packer image with terraform script by configuring variable [`golden_image`](#inputs). (i.e. `zeekautomation/zeek-fluentd-golden-image-v1`)

#### Create Your Own Custom Image
- One can make their own custom image by following [this](packer/README.md) documentation.
- Once the custom image is created, change the [`golden_image`](#inputs) variable value with your custom image name to use it in terraform script. 


### Configure a Service Account
In order to execute this module you must have a Service Account with the following project roles:
- Service Account User - `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`
- Service Account Token Creator - `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator`
- Compute Admin - `roles/compute.admin`
- Compute Network Admin - `roles/compute.networkAdmin`
- Compute Packet Mirroring User - `roles/compute.packetMirroringUser`
- Compute Packet Mirroring Admin - `roles/compute.packetMirroringAdmin`
- Logs Writer - `roles/logging.logWriter`
- Monitoring Metric Writer - `roles/monitoring.metricWriter`
- Storage Admin - `roles/storage.admin`


### Enable APIs
In order to operate with the Service Account you must activate the following APIs on the project where the Service Account was created:

- Compute Engine API - `compute.googleapis.com`
- Service Usage API - `serviceusage.googleapis.com`
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) API - `iam.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Resource Manager API - `cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Logging API - `logging.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Monitoring API - `monitoring.googleapis.com`
- Cloud Storage API - `storage.googleapis.com`


## Usage

```tf
module "google_zeek_automation" {
  source                = "<link>/google_zeek_automation"
  gcp_project           = "project-123"
  service_account_email = "service-account@project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

  subnets = [
    {
      mirror_vpc_subnet_cidr      = ["10.50.0.0/20"]
      collector_vpc_subnet_cidr   = "10.11.0.0/24"
      collector_vpc_subnet_region = "us-west1"
    },
  ]

  mirror_vpc_network = "projects/my-project-123/global/networks/test-mirror"

  mirror_vpc_subnets = {
    "us-west1" = ["projects/my-project-123/regions/us-west1/subnetworks/subnet-01"]
  }

}
```
**Note: For packet mirroring policy, it requires a mirror source to be specified before running the script. So, out of 3 variables: `mirror_vpc_instances` | `mirror_vpc_tags`| `mirror_vpc_subnets`, at least one of them should be specified while running the terraform script.**

Then perform the following commands on the root folder:
- `terraform init` to get the plugins
- `terraform plan` to see the infrastructure plan
- `terraform apply` to apply the infrastructure build
- `terraform destroy` to destroy the built infrastructure

#### Specifying credentials

The Google Zeek Automation uses external scripts to perform a few tasks that are not implemented
by Terraform providers. Because of this the Google Zeek Automation needs a copy of service account
credentials to pass to these scripts. Credentials can be provided via two mechanisms:

1. Explicitly passed to the Google Zeek Automation with the `credentials` variable. This approach
   typically uses the same credentials for the `google` provider and the Google Zeek Automation:
    ```terraform
    provider "google" {
      credentials = "${file(var.credentials)}"
    }

    module "google_zeek_automation" {
      source = "<link>/google_zeek_automation"

      # other variables follow ...
    }
    ```
2. Implicitly provided by the [Application Default Credentials][application-default-credentials]
   flow, which typically uses the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable:
   ```terraform
   # `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` must be set in the environment before Terraform is run.
   provider "google" {
     # Terraform will check the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` variable, so no `credentials`
     # value is needed here.
   }

   module "google_zeek_automation" {
      source = "<link>/google_zeek_automation"

      # Google Zeek Automation will also check the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.
      # other variables follow ...
   }
   ```
